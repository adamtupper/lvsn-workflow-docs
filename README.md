# LVSN Workflow Documentation

This repository provides documentation and examples to help you get started developing your research code on LVSN workstations and deploying your experiments on LVSN compute nodes.

## Getting Started

This documentation is divided into several different pages to make it more manageable. Each page covers a particular topic. Any prerequisite topics will be linked at the beginning of the page.

- [Connecting to Workstations and Compute Nodes via SSH](connecting_via_ssh.md)
- [Available Compute Nodes](available_compute_nodes.md)
- [Reserving Compute Nodes](reserving_compute_nodes.md)

## Terminology

Before continuing, it is important to understand the terminology used in this documentation. For instance, the distinction between workstations and compute nodes.

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| compute node | A machine that is designed for running experiments and is shared between many people. These machines are reserved for short periods and should be completely vacated once a reservation expires. |
| workstation | A machine that is designated for general purpose usage (e.g. day-to-day development). Usually, these machines are assigned to one or a few individuals. |
| personal device| Usually a laptop or desktop computer. Refers to the device you use for your day-to-day work and will used to access LVSN machines.
